# Function-Based-API-View-CRUD
The CRUD API(using Function Based API View) we will be building will allow users to create, read, update, and delete data from the database using HTTP requests. This project will serve as a foundation for more complex APIs in the future, as it covers the basic functionalities that most APIs require.
